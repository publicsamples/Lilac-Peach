# Lilac & Peach

  

A pair of virtual Instruments based on the Roland System 100, Oberheim Xpander and Korg Volca Keys construction kits. Both instruments share the same sample library but have very different layouts and functionality.

  Created with [HISE](http://hise.audio). An open source framework for sample based instruments.

  VST and AU Builds are available for Mac OS & Windows on the [releases page](https://github.com/publicsamples/Lilac-Peach/releases). Linux to follow. The sound library can be [downloaded here.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a24tqzsef0p5tia/AAAlyUDHWaHS3uDkEkqbaR-Ha?dl=0)

Both instruments are under active development. New samples, features and updates will be forthcoming.


**Lilac** takes 3  identical voices, each with a dedicated sequencer/arpeggiator, morphable waveforms, 2 LFOs and 2 envelopes
